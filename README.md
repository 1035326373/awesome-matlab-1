Just look at the published script !   VAR_modeling_script.m contains the modeling of the whole order book as VEC/VAR process.  It uses the great VAR/VEC Joahnsen cointegration framework.  After calibrating your VAR model, you then assess the impact of an order  using shock scenario (sensitivity analysis) to the VAR process.  We deal with 3 scenarii : normal limit order, aggressive limit order & normal market order).  Play section by section the script (to open up figures which contain a lot of graphs).   It contains a power point to help you present this complex topic.   The second item is entirely based on the following paper :  http://www.courant.nyu.edu/~almgren/papers/optliq.pdf   It contains a mupad document : symbolic_demo.mn  I did struggle to get something nice with the symbolic toolbox.  I was not able to drive a continuous workflow and had to recode some equations myself.  I nevertheless managed to get a closed form solution for the simplified linear cost model.   It contains a MATLAB demonstrating script : working_script.m  For more sophisticated cost model, there is no more closed form  and we there highlighted MATLAB numerical optimization abilities (fmincon).   It contains an Optimization Apps you can install.  Just launch the optimization with the default parameters.  And then switch the slider between volatility risk and liquidation costs  to see the trading strategies evolve on the efficient frontier.   It contains a power point to help you present this complex topic.

Meanwhile, advanced typesetting systems like LaTeX and MathML have provided an environment where mathematical symbols can be typeset with precision, but at the cost of typing time and a steep learning curve. In order to facilitate the exchange, preservation and ease of editing of mathematical documents, we propose a method of offline handwritten equational recognition. Our system takes a handwritten document, for example a students calculus homework, then partitions, classifies and parses the document into LaTeX.

We wish to determine the source (e.g. camera) of a digital image, based on a set of attributes that can be extracted from the image. Digital cameras often do proprietary image processing between the light entering the sensors and the image is compressed and stored. Cameras use color filter arrays where each pixel has just one color (red, green or blue) sensor. The camera must estimate the other two colors from the neighboring sensors --- this process is called demosaicing. We attempt to create attributes related to the demosaicing algorithm by computing statistics of how pixel colors relate to their neighbors. We create a classifier from these attributes and report on initial results.

We use signal sub-band energy to construct signal-dependent dictionary and matching pursuit algorithms to obtain a sparse representation of a signal. The coefficients of the sparse vector are used as weights to compute weighted features. These features, along with mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), are used as feature vectors for classification. Experimental results show that the proposed method gives an accuracy as high as 95.6 %, while classifying 14 categories of environmental sound using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM).
